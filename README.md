## TODO

- [ ] MORE TOOLS!!!

  We certainly need to implement more and more tools, and you can contribute in any way you want, such as creating an [issue](https://github.com/zhmushan/tooling/issues/new/choose) or a [pull request](https://github.com/zhmushan/tooling/compare).

- [x] i18n

  Someone complained to me: "I can't read English". I think we should support multiple languages, even if I need to check Wikipedia to know how to say "URL" in Chinese.

- [ ] Sharing

  It must be cool to have more people see what I'm working on. I'm looking for a suitable way to make the generated share links not so long.

- [ ] Search

  When there are so many tools, it is very useful to be able to find the one you want by using information like names or descriptions.

- [ ] Browser extension

  With everything in place, what's stopping me from making a browser extension?
